/**
 * Use this method to replace the JRPinoL1Object#pinoL2Plural array on Capture after adding, removing,
 * or reordering elements. You should call this method immediately after you perform any of these actions.
 * This method will replace the entire array on Capture, including all of its elements and their sub-arrays and
 * sub-objects. When successful, the new array will be added to the JRPinoL1Object#pinoL2Plural property,
 * replacing the existing NSArray.
 *
 * If the array is replaced successfully, the method JRCaptureObjectDelegate#replaceArrayDidSucceedForObject:newArray:named:context:
 * will be called on your delegate. This method will return a pointer to the new array, which is also the same pointer
 * stored in the JRPinoL1Object#pinoL2Plural property, and the name of the replaced array: \c "pinoL2Plural".
 *
 * If unsuccessful, the method JRCaptureObjectDelegate#replaceArrayDidFailForObject:arrayNamed:withError:context:
 * will be called on your delegate.
 *
 * @param delegate
 *   The JRCaptureObjectDelegate that implements the optional delegate methods JRCaptureObjectDelegate#replaceArrayDidSucceedForObject:newArray:named:context:
 *   and JRCaptureObjectDelegate#replaceArrayDidFailForObject:arrayNamed:withError:context:.
 *
 * @param context
 *   Any NSObject that you would like to send through the asynchronous network call back to your delegate, or \c nil.
 *   This object will be passed back to your JRCaptureObjectDelegate as is. Contexts are used across most of the
 *   asynchronous Capture methods to facilitate correlation of the response messages with the calling code. Use of the
 *   context is entirely optional and at your discretion.
 *
 * @warning
 * When successful, the new array will be added to the JRPinoL1Object#pinoL2Plural property,
 * replacing the existing NSArray. The new array will contain new, but equivalent JRPinoL2PluralElement
 * objects. That is to say, the elements will be the same, but they will have new pointers. You should not hold onto
 * any references to the JRPinoL1Object#pinoL2Plural or JRPinoL2PluralElement objects
 * when you are replacing this array on Capture, as the pointers will become invalid.
 * 
 * @note
 * After the array has been replaced on Capture, you can now call JRPinoL2PluralElement#updateOnCaptureForDelegate:context:()
 * on the array's elements. You can check the JRPinoL2PluralElement#canBeUpdatedOnCapture property to determine
 * if an element can be updated or not. If the JRPinoL2PluralElement#canBeUpdatedOnCapture property is equal
 * to \c NO you should replace the JRPinoL1Object#pinoL2Plural array on Capture. Replacing the array will also
 * update any local changes to the properties of a JRPinoL2PluralElement, including sub-arrays and sub-objects.
 *
 * @par
 * If you haven't added, removed, or reordered any of the elements of the JRPinoL1Object#pinoL2Plural array, but
 * you have locally updated the properties of a JRPinoL2PluralElement, you can just call
 * JRPinoL2PluralElement#updateOnCaptureForDelegate:context:() to update the local changes on the Capture server.
 * The JRPinoL2PluralElement#canBeUpdatedOnCapture property will let you know if you can do this.

/**
 * Use this method to determine if the object or element needs to be updated remotely.

 *
 * @return
